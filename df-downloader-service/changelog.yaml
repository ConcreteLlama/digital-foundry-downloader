    date: "2025-02-21"
    changes:
      features:
        - "Added file templates in Content Management settings allowing you to specify custom naming based on info from the content.":
          - "Example: `{{#ifTag 'df direct'}}DF Direct/{{/ifTag}}{{YYYY}}/{{download-filename}}` - this will put all DF Directs into a DF Direct directory, and all content will go into YEAR/FILENAME"
          - "So `DF RETRO Analogue Pocket Review HEVC.mp4` would go to `2021\\DF RETRO Analogue Pocket Review HEVC.mp4.mp4`"
          - "DF Direct 199 1080p H264.mp4` would go to `DF Direct\\2025\\DF Direct 199 1080p H264.mp4a.mp4`"
        - "Added various tools for file maintenance including":
          - "Reorganize files - a tool to allow you to reorganize your existing downloads based on the current configured template"
          - "Maintenance tools":
            - "Clear Missing Files - removes references to files that no longer exist (e.g., if you've downloaded something with the tool but since deleted it)"
            - "Scan for existing content - Scans directory for existing content and adds it to the DB"
            - "Clear empty directories - clears empty directories (useful if you've moved files around a lot from templates)"
        - Added changlog to the UI:
          - Changelog is now available in the UI under the system menu
          - Changelog now displays in a dialog when a new version is detected  
          - Will attempt to fetch the changelog from github first as this is the most up to date source and will help identify if the user is on the latest version
      maintenance:
        - npm audit fix to address security vulnerabilities
      internal:
        - Split the "database" into 3 separate files:
          - content-info-db.json for content info (description, published date, tags, media infos etc)
          - content-status-db.json for local status of content (e.g. downloads, availability based on tiers etc)
          - user-db.json for info about the DF user
        - changelog is now a .yaml file allowing programmatic access to the data
        - Various schema changes
        - Media info now includes both format (e.g. h.264) and type (e.g. VIDEO, AUDIO etc)

  - version: "2.2.6"
    date: "2024-06-24"
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - "Fix an issue on first run where container path was set to be relative to the services directory. This would result in downloads never actually being saved to the host machine. The working dir and destination dirs are now forced to /working_dir and /destination_dir when running in a container."

  - version: "2.2.5"
    date: "2024-06-24"
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - "Subtitles":
          - "Fixed bug where downloads would fail if subtitles could not be found (some content will not have subtitles at all, and regardless of this the download should still succeed)"

  - version: "2.2.4"
    date: "2024-06-20"
    changes:
      features:
        - "YouTube video now embedded on content detail page if available"

        - "Content Metadata":
          - "Auto-refresh when opening content item"
          - "Refresh before download and when download is triggered (useful for delayed auto downloads as this could result in better match for desired format)"
        - "Automatic Downloads":
          - "Automatic download is now skipped if the content is already downloading or downloaded (for example if you have download delay of 10 minutes but manually trigger the download before, it will now not perform a second unnecessary download)"
        - "Subtitles":
          - "Use correct eng language code when injecting eng subs"
        - "YouTube":
          - "Implemented a rudimentary method to detect and handle sponsored videos that contain additional content at the start. Since the downloaded videos from DF do not include this sponsored content, it could cause the subtitles to be significantly out of sync. Current is to offset the subtitles and remove the irrelevant ones if the YouTube video length exceeds our video length by more than 5 seconds (this works entirely on time difference and doesn't do anything fancy like try to understand the subs)"
      bugfixes:
        - "UI":
          - "Fixed console errors related to unique keys"
          - "Added keys to all routes"

    known_issues:
      - "Subtitles":
        - "Fetching subtitles on a video that already has them does not replace the subs. Currently the only option is to re-download the video."
